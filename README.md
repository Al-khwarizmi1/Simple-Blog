# Simple-Blog
This is a simple blog application created using PHP

## Requirements
- Mysql version: 5.6.17
- PHP Version: 5.5.12
- Apache Version: 2.4.12

## How to setup
To set the this up you'll need to download the repo and setup the database.
I reccomend using phpmyadmin if you prefer a graphical user interface.
You may import the SQL script in the repo and either run it on your server, or import with phpMyAdmin.

## Why I made this
I wanted to learn the basics of creating an application for blogging with PHP
The idea was to leverage programming concepts to learn more about basic PHP programming, OOP, Database querying with Mysql, 
using regex to create pretty urls, handling images, handling XML, creating administrative access, email validation, etc...

## How I made this
I followed the book:
*PHP for Absolute Begginners*
  -by Jason Lengstorf
  
I modified the code to my liking and leveraged up-to-date software.
